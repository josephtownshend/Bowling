### Weekend Challenge 5 - Bowling Scorecard

Started Sunday 30/06/19


### Logic

- 10 frames
  - 2 bowls per frame
    - Unless strike in which case only 1 bowl for frame
      - Strike is only made on first ball of frame - otherwise it's a spare

- Strike scores 10 + (next frame bowl 1 + next frame bowl 2)
- Spare scores 10 + next frame bowl 1
